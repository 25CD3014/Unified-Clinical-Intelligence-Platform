## [2026-01-06 18:07:26] Value Proposition Summary: 1. Operational Efficiency: Automated site aggregation and ML-driven bottleneck identification for 1071 sites. 2. Regulatory Compliance: Automated Mass Balance calculations with AI recommendation matrix for stability testing. 3. Safety Insight: High-speed, 100% local semantic search across 40+ coding reports for cross-study signal detection. 4. Proactive Management: Predictive country-level risk heatmaps for global trial oversight.

## [2026-01-06 18:08:52] Core Problem Statement Mapping: 1. Operational Intelligence: Resolves 'Data Silos' by automating aggregation and ML-driven bottleneck detection. 2. Safety Search: Resolves 'Patient Safety Gaps' via cross-study semantic search for early signal detection. 3. Mass Balance Engine: Resolves 'Stability Mystery' by automating complex forced degradation calculations and AI recommendations. Goal: Transition from Manual/Reactive to AI-Powered/Proactive clinical intelligence.
