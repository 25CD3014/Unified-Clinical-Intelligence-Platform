Integrated insight-driven data-flow model 

Problem Statement: - 

Clinical trials generate vast amounts of heterogeneous data from multiple sources, including 
electronic data capture (EDC) systems, laboratory reports, site operational metrics, and monitoring 
logs. However, these data streams often remain siloed, leading to delayed identification of operational 
bottlenecks, inconsistent data quality, and limited visibility for scientific decision-making. Current 
processes rely heavily on manual review and fragmented communication between Clinical Trial 
Teams (CTT), Clinical Research Associates (CRAs), and investigational sites, which increases cycle 
times and operational risk. 

 Challenge Statement: - 

There is a critical need for an integrated solution that can ingest and harmonize clinical and 
operational data in near real-time, apply advanced analytics to generate actionable insights, and 
proactively detect data quality issues and operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, the solution should 
leverage Generative and Agentic AI capabilities to enable intelligent collaboration, automate routine 
tasks, and provide context-aware recommendations to stakeholders, thereby accelerating trial 
execution and improving scientific outcomes.”

Key Points 

Title 

Improving Follow-Up (FU) Data Collection for Patient Safety  

In the pharmaceutical industry, Pharmacovigilance plays an important part in assessing ongoing safety 
profile of the product. When a patient experiences an adverse event related to a company’s 
medication, companies must collect adverse event information. Most often the initial report lacks key 
information, and the company initiates a follow up with reporter for seeking any missing information for 
a comprehensive assessment and ensure patient safety. However, many follow-ups attempt with 
patients or their healthcare providers fail because complex and frequent requests overwhelm busy 
professionals and discourage responses, and growing concerns about scams or fraud make reporters 
more cautious and less likely to engage. 

The 
Problem 

Reasons for Follow-Up Data Collection:  

- International regulations require companies to collect all necessary information and follow up when 
initial reports are incomplete or unclear.  

- Organizations are required to submit aggregate reports/RMPs with comprehensive information. 
Regulators use these reports to determine whether medicine should remain on the market or require 
additional warnings. 

- Companies must comply with worldwide reporting rules. Failure to obtain complete information can 
create compliance issues and erode trust with regulators.

(Strategi
c 
Impact) 

The goal is to develop a practical, globally standardized solution that uses new technology and process 
improvements to streamline follow-up data collection.  
The solution should:  
- Be easy for patients and doctors to use, regardless of location. 
- Tailor communication for different regions and cultures while ensuring security and privacy. 
- Use digital tools to automate routine steps and help focus on higher-risk cases. 
- Ensure that all collected data is accurate. 
- Create secure, user-friendly digital platforms for communication and data entry that can be 
customized per region. 

- Implement automation and artificial intelligence to prioritize follow-ups and check for missing or 
inconsistent information automatically. 

- Use real-time data validation and multilingual support to reduce manual errors and overcome 
geographic or language barriers. 

- Build cross-country teams to share lessons learned and develop best practices for handling follow-
ups effectively. 

- Offer support to healthcare professionals and patients to encourage higher participation in follow-ups. 

- Ensures patient safety through faster risk identification and response. 

- Maintains compliance with global regulations and builds credibility with authorities and the public. 

- Increases the quality and reliability of safety data, supporting better informed decisions that improve 
patient outcomes. 

- Helps pharmaceutical companies operate more efficiently, avoid costly delays, and maintain a good 
reputation. 

 
 
3.  Problem Statement: Mass Balance Calculation Methods Evaluation in Analytical Forced 

Degradation Studies 

Background: Mass balance (MB) calculations play a critical role in forced degradation studies, as 
they help verify whether all components of a drug substance, both the active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API) and its degradants, are properly accounted for during stress testing. This assessment 
ensures the analytical method is stability-indicating and provides insight into degradation pathways. 
Regulatory expectations emphasize that MB should be close to 100%, indicating minimal loss due to 
factors such as volatility, adsorption, or undetected species. When MB values are significantly lower, it 
signals potential gaps in method sensitivity or incomplete detection of degradants, prompting further 
investigation. Various calculation approaches, including simple, absolute, and relative mass balance 
methods, are used to evaluate completeness and detectability, each with its own strengths and 
limitations depending on the level of degradants and analytical variability. 

What is Mass Balance? 

Mass Balance is a way to check if all components of a drug substance (API and its degradants) are 
accounted for during forced degradation studies. It helps confirm: 

•  Completeness of analytical methods 

•  Understanding of degradation pathways 

Regulatory Expectation: 

Regulators expect that forced degradation studies demonstrate: 

•  A scientifically sound approach to calculate MB 

•  Reasonable recovery of API and degradation products (usually close to 100%) 

Identification of gaps if MB is significantly low 

Common MB Calculation Methods 

Hypothetical situation:  

• 

Initial sample: API = 98%, Degradants = 0.5% 

•  Stressed sample: API = 82.5%, Degradants = 4.9% 

1.  Simple Mass Balance (SMB) 

Formula: MB=API in stressed sample + degradants in stressed sample 

API = 82.5%, Degradants = 4.9%; MB = 87.4% 

Limitation: Does not consider initial API content; can mislead if initial assay ≠ 100%. 

2.  Absolute Mass Balance (AMB) 

Formula: 
AMB= (API stressed + Degradants stressed) / (API initial + Degradants initial) ×100  
Initial = 98.5%, Stressed = 87.4%; AMB = 88.7% 
Limitation: Acceptable thresholds can mislead when degradation is minimal or undetected. 

 
 
 
 
 
3.  Absolute Mass Balance Deficiency (AMBD) 

Formula: AMBD=100−AMB 
AMBD = 100 - 88.7 = 11.3% 
Use: Indicates how much is missing. 

4.  Relative Mass Balance (RMB) 

Formula: RMB= (Increase in Degradants / Loss of API) * 100  
Increase in Degradants = 4.4%, Loss of API = 15.5%; RMB = 28.4% 
Insight: Shows detectability of degradation products. 

5.  Relative Mass Balance Deficiency (RMBD) 

Formula: RMBD=100−RMB 

RMBD = 100 – 28.4 = 71.6% 
Use: Helpful when degradation is significant. 

Which Method to Choose? 

Regulatory Perspective: 
No single method fits all cases. Choice depends on: 

•  Drug substance properties 

•  Level of degradation 

•  Analytical method sensitivity 

•  Pathway complexity 

Challenge Tracks: 

    Track 1: Literature-Based Formula Optimization 

•  Goal: Critically evaluate existing MB formulas using scientific literature and regulatory 

guidelines. 

•  Tasks: 

o  Review and compare. Simple Mass Balance (SMB); Absolute Mass Balance (AMB); 
Absolute Mass Balance Deficiency (AMBD); Relative Mass Balance (RMB); Relative 
Mass Balance Deficiency (RMBD) 

o 

Identify theoretical gaps or limitations 

o  Propose a new or improved MB formula with thresholds highlighting the need for 

mass balance investigations 

•  Outcome: A scientifically justified formula or selection framework for MB calculations. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      Track 2: Experimental Validation of MB Methods 

•  Goal: Conduct a forced degradation study to empirically test MB methods. 

•  Tasks: 

o  Select a model drug and develop a stability-indicating method 

o  Apply stress conditions and collect degradation data 

o  Calculate MB using all five methods and analyze the performance 

•  Outcome: Data-driven recommendation of the most reliable MB formula and thresholds. 

Expected Deliverables: 

•  Comparative analysis report 

•  Recommendation matrix 

•  Draft white paper
